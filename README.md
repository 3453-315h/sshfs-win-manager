# SSHFS-Win Manager

## Installation
First you must have SSHFS-Win installed on your Windows computer.  
Follow they [installation instructions](https://github.com/billziss-gh/sshfs-win/blob/master/README.md) before continue.  

Once SSHFS-Win is installed, download the setup from the 'releases' section and install it.  
By now, only password-based authentication is available.
